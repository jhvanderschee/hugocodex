title: 'Image gallery'

### Introduction

This script creates an image gallery. The script reads all images from a specific (user-defined) folder in the assets directory of Hugo, automagically crops them to 300px squares and shows them in rows of five.

{{< image-gallery gallery_dir="/uploads/album" >}}

### How it works

The script searches for any file in the folder ‘album’ in the assets directory of Hugo. It creates an image tag with a thumbnail for these images. The thumbnail is a 300 pixel wide square cropped version of the image. The script wraps the thumbnail in a link, which links to a larger version and will trigger a lightbox if present. The caption is the file name without extension.
