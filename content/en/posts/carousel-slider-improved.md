I was looking at [Flickety](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) from Metafizzy, after I created a [modern version of their Isotope component](https://www.usecue.com/blog/isotope-in-just-60-lines/). I noticed that Flickety supports grabbing and dragging slides on desktop. After some searching I found [this codepen](https://codepen.io/thenutz/pen/VwYeYEE?editors=1010), which did the same. I added this functionality to my 3kb slider component... and voila... The sliders/carousels now support dragging with the mouse as well.

I might have just saved you 25 dollar in licensing fees! Happy coding!
