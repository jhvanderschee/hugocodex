##  Context : templating / layouts approach

We are (always) improving the process/workflow. Now that we have learned the basics of: is it time for a more elaborated Templating / Layouts strategy ?


## A first Templating approach 

When speaking about Hugo Layouts : you tipically simply define

```
my-hugo-project
|._ layouts/ Home (or index) html template
           |._ _default/single.html
           |. _/default/list.html
```

Whe already spoke about [how to get started](/en/getting-started/)  and use partials for (e.g.) header and footer.

Fine. As a starter...
The point here is that you tipically would end up re-using code from those... having to copy some snippets around this 3 'starter' layouts for a basic website.
But wait... what if the website requires more templating flexibility ? Or ... the overall (User Interface / UI ~ CSS styling) design requires some more complexity ?

## We can do better : hello baseof.html layout and 'blocks' to the rescue

### Block definition

Let's create a content block  :

```
{{ block "content" . }}

{{ end }}
```

> NOTE: the context aka 'the dot'  '.' is required 

### Block definition 
Ah√°. Now feel free to reuse it wherever you want in other templates (e.g. in the 'single.html' or 'list.html' ), by defining them following this syntax inside other layouts:

```
{{ define "content" }}

  {{ .Content }}

{{ end }}
```

Last but not least: did you knew that you can override a given block in a specific template ? 

[Mike 's video tutorial](https://gohugo.io/templates/base/) in official Hugo Doc shows us how to in a more detailed and visual way.
