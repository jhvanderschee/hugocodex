So you have a Hugo website but you have no CMS? Check out [Sitepins, a CMS for Hugo](https://sitepins.com/)! From somebody who created [a CMS for Hugo](https://cms.usecue.com) himself... let me tell you: this is good! A very smooth interface (using React). Easy on the eyes... full-featured... and best of all: check that [pricing page](https://sitepins.com/pricing)!!! No way I can (or want to) compete with that! I am sure that once this goes out of beta the price will go up, so make sure you grab yourself on of those amazing deals on this awesome product.
