Fenix and me (Joost van der Schee) talked for almost an hour about static site generators and the Jamstack, based on Matt Biilman's presentation 'Jamstack 2024!'. It reflects on the upcomming of SSG's and the Jamstack. We analyze how Matt looks at it and how he thinks the Jamstack should move forward.
