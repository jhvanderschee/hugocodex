Fenix and me (Joost van der Schee) talked for almost an hour about static site generators and the Jamstack, based on Matt Biilman's presentation 'Jamstack 2024!'. It reflects on the upcomming of SSG's and the Jamstack. We analyze how Matt Biilmann looks at his brainchild and how he thinks the Jamstack should move forward.

Check it out! And because this is our first try at a pod-/screencast, [do let us know](mailto:joost@vdschee.nl) what you think of it! Should we create more content like this? We know the presentation is rough around the edges, but we wanted you to feel like you were in the (virtual) room with us. Looking forward to your feedback.
