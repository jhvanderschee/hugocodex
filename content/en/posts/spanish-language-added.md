Still in early beta, and far from fully translated, is our [Spanish version of this website](/es/). Do not expect the Spanish version to hold (exactly) the same information as the English one, as the Spanish version is maintained by Fenix, while the English version is maintained by me (Joost). Fenix is very passionate about Hugo and 'the stackless way'. We share the same vision on web development. We meet every week to discuss 'all things Hugo' and we even do some website assignments together. All in all a great collaboration! I am looking forward to Fenix his contributions on the Hugo Codex website!
