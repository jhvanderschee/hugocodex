My friend and colleague Guus came with a great idea: let Hugo parse the content and transform lists with only images to carousels. A vibe coding demo and some optimalisations later, we now have a great new feature for Hugo. You can check it out [here](https://hugocodex.org/add-ons/slider-carousel/). The old carousel is also still available if you need a more complex setup. Thanks Guus and happy coding everybody!
