Sometimes all you need is a good excuse... I just found one to update Hugobricks, the ultimate Hugo theme. Not sure it is? [Check out this page](https://www.hugobricks.preview.usecue.com/demo-paragliding/). Doesn't that look awesome? I think it does. Go make your own website, using Hugobricks. The theme is MIT licensed. Check out the [Github Repository](https://github.com/jhvanderschee/hugobricks) for licensing details.
