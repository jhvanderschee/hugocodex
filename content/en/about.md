### For front-end developers

Hugo Codex is created by Fenix and Joost to make it easier for fellow front-end developers to choose for static web technology in their next project. The [getting started guide](/getting-started) lets you start from scratch. If you want to know more about Hugo, please visit the official Hugo documentation. The link can be found in the menu at the top.

### Why Hugo?

Hugo is the fastest popular static site generator. Static sites are better for performance, they're cheaper to build and maintain, and they're much more secure than traditional database driven websites. Thus offering a great added value for front-end developers and their clients.
